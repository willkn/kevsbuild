            proposals to develop the former Campsall Club. Due to Covid 19 we are unable to carry out our normal Public
            Consultation process and have instead prepared an online consultation portal to allow feedback &amp;
            dialogue with local stakeholders. This portal will be open for a period of two weeks and will close on the
            <b>14th June 2021</b>.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Housing are proposing to build 19 family homes on land formally
            known as the Campsall Club. The site has been derelict for several years and the former club has fallen into
            disrepair, becoming a focus of antisocial behaviour. The homes we are planning will go some way to address
            the housing shortage in Doncaster, we have liaised with DMBC to understand the housing need in the area and
            our proposals for a mix of 2 and 3 bedroomed family homes address this. We are committed to delivering
            affordable homes for the benifit of the community, our proposals are to provide homes for affordable rent.
            Together Housing are seeking to engage with the community and obtain your feedback on our proposals prior to
            finalising our design and submitting for Planning Approval.&nbsp; If granted we will look to complete the
            construction of the homes within approximately 1 year of starting construction works.
